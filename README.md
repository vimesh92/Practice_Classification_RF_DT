1. Data was imbalanced and i used sampling techinque using
  a. Resample

  c. SMOTE
2. Used Grid Search for Hyper-parameter tuning for Random Forest
3. False Negatives decreased drastically in Random Forest for downsampled training set
4. However Accuracy for Decsion Tree was much better than Random Forest
